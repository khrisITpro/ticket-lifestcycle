To create tickets, users have to fill out a form from the ticket portal. Within the portal, the user can detail their IT related issues. Tickets are created by using a Help Topic, a descriptive outline of the issue, and the details of the issue that are all written as if it were an email.

From the perspective of an admin, they will receive the ticket requests from their panel once they are sent. The admins can reassign tickets to an agent or appropriate team. The severity level of the issue is determined and assigned accordingly to make sure appropriate tickets are solved within an SLA. Here, the Agent viewed this ticket and assigned it to the System Administrators and updated the severity level from default to Sev-A.

When resolving tickets, it is important to have strong communication. One has to communicate with their team and the affected users. Tickets come and go with different issues and should be assigned appropriately to different service agents. Below, one of the tickets are assigned to Ron from Kim and Kim collaborates with him to resolve the other ticket. Documentation is crucial to a successful environment. Tickets need to be documented properly so they can be used as reference if similar issues show up in the future.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
This project deepened my understanding of the full ticket lifecycle in osTicket, from intake to resolution, and how each stage ensures efficient issue management. Across all three osTicket projects: pre-requistes, post-install configuration, and ticket lifecycle, I gained comprehensive hands-on experience in deploying, customizing, and managing an open-source help desk system to support real-world IT service operations.
